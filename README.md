This is the README.md file. This should give you clear instructions on how to operate the program.

the program's purpous was to give users (you) the ability to control the bot with your voice. There are limited directions now (forward, backward, rotate, sing). 

Note: For directions (forwards and backwards) there is no variable you can input with your voice. It is a preset distance that cannot be modified. Same thing with rotation, it rotates 90 degrees every time you give the command (in the direction you tell it to).
