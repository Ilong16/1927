This is the README.md file. This should give you clear instructions on how to operate the program.

the program's purpous was to give users (you) the ability to control the bot with your voice. There are limited directions now (forward, backward, rotate, sing). 

Important Information: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For directions (forwards and backwards) there is no variable you can input with your voice. It is a preset distance that cannot be modified. Same thing with rotation, it rotates 90 degrees every time you give the command (in the direction you tell it to). 

This program controls Bot #3.

Command List
-------------
Beep - Makes  the bot beep
Rotate Left - Rotates the bot to the left
Rotate Right - Rotates the bot to the right
Forward - Moves the bot forward

You have to click the "Command" button to issue a new command.
